# Customer-Segmentation
The main aim of this project is to find and predict customers from the existing pool of customers who can be targeted to increase the revenue of the mall. For this discovery of customers, one of the popular data science applications Customer Segmentation is used.

By using this unsupervised learning method we will be able to identify such potential customers who are more likely to spend more in the mall. After identifying the customer pool, proper strategies could be made to attract them and further increase the revenue.
